# Purpose of user research

## What is user research?
User research is a study of who the users of a service are, how they behave and what their motivations for using the service are. Simply put, user research is a set of techniques you can use to consistently deliver exceptional customer service.

Youâ€™ll use different user research techniques depending on your current phase of service design. The purpose of a user research technique like "usability testing" ranges from trying to generate ideas (early in the product design lifecycle), to validating a prototype (towards the end of a product design lifecycle).
